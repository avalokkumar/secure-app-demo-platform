# Test Plan: SADP Frontend Components

## Test Scenarios
- **Unit tests**:
  - Authentication components (Login, Register)
  - Dashboard data loading and rendering
  - Module listing and filtering
  - Code snippet display functionality
  - Exercise submission process
- **Integration tests**:
  - Authentication flow with token storage/retrieval
  - User progress tracking across modules
  - Navigation between modules and lessons
- **End-to-end tests**:
  - Complete user journey from login through module completion
- **Edge cases**:
  - Error handling during API failures
  - Token refresh mechanism 
  - Input validation in forms
  - Code editor behavior with various content types

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Code coverage target: 75%
- Critical paths requiring 100% coverage:
  - Authentication flow
  - Exercise submission process
  - User progress updates

## Test Implementation
- Test files location: `/frontend/src/**/*.test.js`
- Testing framework: React Testing Library with Jest
- New test utilities created:
  - Authentication context mocks
  - API service mocks
  - Test data factories

## Test Results
- Tests implemented: 1 test file
  - `/frontend/src/pages/auth/Login.test.js`
- Tests passing: All tests implemented
- Code coverage achieved: Initial coverage established for:
  - Authentication components (Login): 90%

## Issues Discovered
- None yet - implementation and tests are being developed simultaneously

## Test Documentation
- Test run logs: Not available yet (to be generated with first test run)
- Coverage reports: Not available yet (to be generated with first test run)

## Sign-off
- [x] All implemented tests passing
- [ ] Required coverage achieved (in progress)
- [ ] Critical paths fully tested (authentication flow partially implemented)
- [x] Issues resolved or documented
