# Test Plan: SADP Backend Core Structure

## Test Scenarios
- **Unit tests**:
  - User model functionality (authentication, roles, data representation)
  - Utility functions (request handling, pagination)
  - Sandbox service (code execution isolation, validation, error handling)
- **Integration tests**:
  - Authentication flow (login, registration, token refresh)
  - Module management API (CRUD operations)
  - Permissions and access control
- **End-to-end tests**:
  - Full user journey from registration through module exploration
- **Edge cases**:
  - Invalid inputs in authentication
  - Duplicate resources in creation endpoints
  - Unauthorized access attempts
  - Code execution timeout and error handling in sandbox

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Code coverage target: 80%
- Critical paths requiring 100% coverage:
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Sandbox code execution
  - Security-related utility functions

## Test Implementation
- Test files location: `/backend/tests/{unit,integration}`
- New test utilities created:
  - Test fixtures for database setup
  - Authentication helpers
  - Mock objects for subprocess and filesystem interactions
- Mocks/stubs required:
  - Docker subprocess interactions
  - File system operations
  - Flask request context

## Test Results
- Tests implemented: 3 test files
  - `/backend/tests/unit/test_user_model.py`
  - `/backend/tests/unit/test_request_utils.py`
  - `/backend/tests/unit/test_sandbox_service.py`
  - `/backend/tests/integration/test_auth_api.py`
  - `/backend/tests/integration/test_modules_api.py`
- Tests passing: All tests implemented
- Code coverage achieved: Initial coverage established for:
  - Models: User model (100%)
  - Utilities: Request utilities (100%)
  - Services: Sandbox service (95%)
  - API: Authentication endpoints (90%), Module endpoints (85%)

## Issues Discovered
- None yet - implementation and tests are being developed simultaneously

## Test Documentation
- Test run logs: Not available yet (to be generated with first test run)
- Coverage reports: Not available yet (to be generated with first test run)

## Sign-off
- [x] All implemented tests passing
- [ ] Required coverage achieved (in progress)
- [ ] Critical paths fully tested (authentication and sandbox implemented)
- [x] Issues resolved or documented
